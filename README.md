## Tech Stack

### Gameplay Ability System
GAS has a huge part in this project. It is involved in the character skills, attributes, status effects, object interactions and progression. There is a variety of abilities such as melee, projectiles, beam (trace), area and passive. The most difficult part of it is its setup as it requires a lot of boilerplate work, but as soon as it is ready it is really scalable and allowed me to easily expand it with a lot of new mechanics, such as a melee combo system and ability charges.

A difficult part of implementing GAS was to integrate it with the widgets. The project uses the MVC pattern with widget controller classes that work as links between the ability system information and the widgets. Abilities descriptions, icons, properties, cooldowns, charges and other information are stored in data assets and organized with Gameplay Tags that maps abilities, attributes and status effects.
