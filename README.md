Circle of the Elements is a Top Down RPG with a druid protagonist that fights goblins to free the elemental spirits they imprisioned in jewels. The freed spirits join the druid by providing new elemental powers.

## Tech Stack

### Gameplay Ability System
GAS has a huge part in this project. It is involved in the character skills, attributes, status effects, object interactions and progression. There is a variety of abilities such as melee, projectiles, beam (trace), area and passive. The most difficult part of it is its setup as it requires a lot of boilerplate work, but as soon as it is ready it is really scalable and allowed me to easily expand it with a lot of new mechanics, such as a melee combo system and ability charges.
